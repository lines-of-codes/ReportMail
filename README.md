A Discord bot that can help you with reporting people to servers!

Just a clarification, If you ever wandered into the history commit to the first commit and found a bot token, That token doesn't work anymore. I've already regenerate it.

## Setup this project locally
Create a Discord application at the (Discord Developer Portal)[https://discord.com/developers].
Create a Bot inside the Discord application you just created.

Create a file in the project root named `.env`,
Setup the file like this:

```
TOKEN=your discord bot token
APPID=your application Id
```

Then, just simply run the following commands:

```bash
npm i # or `yarn`
node .
```
